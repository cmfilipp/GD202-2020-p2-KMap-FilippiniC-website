      <p class="w3-text-grey"> The behavior of students play a major role in the ability for campuses to achieve sustainability. After interviewing students, it is clear that not only the lack of knowledge, but the convenience and overall “laziness” of students factor into their negligent behavior. In researching, I learned the importance of analyzing their behaviors and motivations for, and for not performing certain tasks and investigating ways to get them to perform additional behaviors. A recent study revealed getting students to perform sustainable behaviors require some effort to change students’ environment to help make behaviors more convenient to perform. Additonally, it reveals students are motivated by incentives, both intrinsically and extrinsically, to perform sustainably.
