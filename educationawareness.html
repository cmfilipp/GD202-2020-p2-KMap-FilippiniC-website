      <p class="w3-text-grey">A major issue we face with waste management is <L class="w3-text-black"> awareness. 
          </L></p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Universities have led the way for environmental awareness and change. While they are known to promote environmental responsibility, actions don’t always match the campus mission.
     </p>
     
       <p class="w3-text-grey"> Recent studies have shown that students are not utilizing resources provided by their university or college. According to a recent study at Dalhousie University, it was revealed that the majority of students feel they are aware of the environmental issues, yet observation studies showed high percentages of recyclable and compostable material in garbage cans (Brooks et al., 2006). It appears universities are falling short in educating students and achieving sustainable habits on campus.
     </p>
     
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Despite the convenience of NC State’s waste bins, students are still exhibiting a lack of sustainable awareness through their negilgent behavior. 
     </p>
     
     <p class="w3-text-grey"> Although some consider recycling to be an “easy” form of sustainable behavior, after interviewing students it seems it is not an easy task unless individuals have knowledge and awareness to do so correctly.
