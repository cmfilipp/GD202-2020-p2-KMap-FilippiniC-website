      <p class="w3-text-grey">Another major issue we face with waste on campus is the use of <L class="w3-text-black"> single-use items
          </L></p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> In my observations and through interviews with students, it became evident that many students often consume single-use coffee cups. This produces a lot of trash on campus. 
     </p>
       <p class="w3-text-grey"> This problem is seen on many other campuses. For example, at Canada’s Green University, Prince Edward University, there was a study conducted which found that disposable coffee cups represented 34 percent of the university’s waste, and the largest proportion by weight of all drink containers; over 5,000 cups were sent to the landfill each week (Tucker).
     </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey"> If you took all the paper coffee cups that the dining Commons goes through in a typical year and laid them end to end, that line of cups would be nearly long enough to connect Lewiston with Portland, about 36 miles away. And it would number about 750,000 cups (Bates College).
     </p>
     
      <p class="w3-text-grey">A major university like NC State needs and uses lots of resources.<L class="w3-text-black"> How those resources are used and managed matters.
          </L></p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> For NC State's Waste Reduction and Recycling, zero waste is defined as sending nothing to the landfill. Instead, WRR focuses first on source reduction, followed by reuse, composting, and then recycling.
     </p>
       <p class="w3-text-grey"> A zero waste approach to living promotes an economically responsible, environmentally sound, and socially just community. Choosing to reduce, or even eliminate, waste-to-landfill is one of the easiest individual actions that can immediately impact the environment and economy.

        <p class="w3-text-grey">““Obviously, we prefer resuables. In terms of big campus  enterprises, they do have a few items that are single-use, and we are working on ways to try and change that to reusables. For example, they have some to-go coffee cups. Rave catering is moving towards all compostables being their standard. The oval, about a year ago, implemented brining in ral forks. They are active in trying to find options.” </p>
